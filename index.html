                    <p>This report shows the corresponding analysis for STORE_DEMO_DB.STORE_DEMO_SCH.V_TOP_SELLING_PRODUCTS:</p>

                    <ul><li>1. The view is named V_TOP_SELLING_PRODUCTS and is created in the store_demo_db.store_demo_sch schema.</li><li>2. The view is based on a SELECT statement that joins two tables: ORDER_ITEMS and PRODUCTS.</li><li>3. The join is performed on the PRODUCT_ID column, which is common to both tables.</li><li>4. The view selects three columns: PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, and TOTAL_QUANTITY, which is calculated using the SUM aggregation function on the QUANTITY column of the ORDER_ITEMS table.</li><li>5. The view groups the results by PRODUCT_ID and PRODUCT_NAME.</li><li>6. The view orders the results in descending order based on the TOTAL_QUANTITY column.</li></ul>
